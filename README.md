# API Backend for AutoLib
Currently in development.

## Dev Updates:
May 10 (Johannes)
- Schema adjustment! 
  - Redundant status fields have been removed from resources and requests tables
  - requests table has an added completed_at field (from which status can be inferred)
  - Make sure to run /api/debug/reset before testing!
- GET /resources will no longer have a status field for each resource
- GET /resources/:id has status object (dynamically queried)
- PUT /users now working. Expects full user object - fields missing in the user record will be deleted from database.

May 9 (Johannes)
- POST /login now working. Expects object with email address. Sets session cookie.
- GET /logout now working. Destroys session.
- GET /me will return the current user record if session is logged in.
- GET /api/openlibrary/by_isbn/:isbn now working. Takes any isbn10 or isbn13 an object of this form (or an error):
  ```
  {
    isbn: "0596516681",
    title: "Head First Servlets and JSP",
    authors: "Bert Bates, Bryan Basham",
    coverImage: "https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780596516680-L.jpg",
    description: "An important book about programming..."
  }
  ```

May 8 (Johannes)
- Schema: resources table now using strings for authors and genres fields (no separate tables)
- POST /api/resources now working, expecting JSON data as follows (example):
  ```
  {
    "isbn": "9780261102439",
    "title": "The Lord of the Rings",
    "authors": "J.R.R. Tolkien, Ian Holm, John Le Mesurier",
    "description": "The most influential fantasy novel ever written.",
    "genres": "Fiction, Fantasy"    
  }
  ```
  - returns the newly created record or an error
  - ```isbn```, ```title``` and ```authors``` are required
  - ```description``` and ```genres``` are optional
  - The fields ```cover_image```, ```current_possessor```, ```owner``` and ```status``` are optional at this time as well. We'll likely supply that data on the backend once we've figured out sessions.
- GET /api/users now functional (returns all users, not filterable, we probably do not need this in production at all - convenience functionality for now)
- GET /api/users/:id now functional
- POST /api/users now working, expecting JSON data as follows (example):
  ```
  {
    "first_name": "Elizabeth",
    "last_name": "Williams",
    "email": "elizabeth@gmail.com",
    "street_address": "507 E 6th Ave",
    "zip_code": "V5T 1K9",
    "province": "BC",
    "city": "Vancouver",
    "country": "Canada"
  }
  ```
  - returns the newly created record or an error

May 6 (Johannes)

- GET /api/debug/reset now functional
