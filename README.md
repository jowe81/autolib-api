## <a name="debug-reset"></a> Debug/Reset
### ```GET /api/debug/reset```
Recreate tables and seed the database.
## <a name="olib"></a> OpenLibrary data retrieval
### ```GET /api/openlibrary/by_isbn/:isbn```
#### Retrieve book information by ISBN through http://openlibrary.org
##### Takes any ISBN10 or ISBN13 and will return an object of this form (or an error):
  ```
  {
    isbn: "0596516681",
    title: "Head First Servlets and JSP",
    authors: "Bert Bates, Bryan Basham",
    coverImage: "https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780596516680-L.jpg",
    description: "An important book about programming..."
  }
  ```
## Session
### ```POST /login```
#### Authenticate a user. Will return a user record and a session cookie on success.
Email suffices - password check not implemented.
```
{
  "email": "john@gmail.com"
}
```
### ```GET /logout```
#### End the current session

### ```GET /me```
Convenience route for dev purposes - returns current user.
## Resources
### How Resource Status is determined

There is no status field on either the resources table or the requests table. The API server will provide dynamically determined status information in a ```status``` property on each resource object. Here is how it works:
![Determining Resource Status](./doc/img/dynamic_resource_status.png)




### ```GET /api/resources```
#### Retrieve/Search Catalogue of Resources
- Note that by default the status object will not be present on each record
- To include the status object with the response, add ```withStatus``` as a query parameter like so:
  ```
  GET /api/resources?withStatus
  ```
- Format of resource objects returned:
  ```
  {
    id: 73,
    isbn: "9780060652388",
    title: "A grief observed",
    authors: "C. S. Lewis",
    genres: "Theology",
    description: null,
    cover_image: "https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/0060652381-L.jpg",
    current_possessor_id: 8,
    owner_id: 4,
    created_at: "2022-05-14T17:52:04.321Z",
    updated_at: "2022-05-14T17:52:04.321Z"
  }
  ```

##### Get all:
```
#Get all
GET /api/resources                     

#Limit result set
GET /api/resources?limit=n             
```
##### Filter:
```
#Search for title
GET /api/resources?title=rings

#Search by author
GET /api/resources?author=Tolkien

#Search by genre
GET /api/resources?genre=fantasy

#Search by owner ID
GET /api/resources?owner_id=1

#Search by current possessor
GET /api/resources?current_possessor_id=1
```
##### Order results:
```
#Order by authors
GET /api/resources?order_by=authors

#Order by genres
GET /api/resources?order_by=genres

#Order by title
GET /api/resources?order_by=title

#Order by most recently added
GET /api/resources?order_by=created_at 
```

### ```GET /api/resources/random```
#### Retrieve randomly selected resource records from the database
##### Get a maximum of 5 resources:
```
GET /api/resources/random?limit=5
```


### ```GET /api/resources/:id```
#### Retrieve a single resource record with related data
##### Get the resource with id 3:
```

```
This will return a resource object with full details including current status and address as follows:
```

Request creation will only succeed if resource is available, that is,
- it exists
- it does not have an open request
- it does not have a completed request that has completed less than ```env.BORROWING_SPAN_DAYS``` days ago
- For more detail see flow chart for dynamic status determination available at https://github.com/merwynpgithub/decentralized-library/blob/master/Requests%20and%20Resource%20Status.pdf

### ```GET /api/requests/from_me_for_others/pending``` _(protected)_

# <a name="dev-log"></a> Development Log

May 21 (Johannes)
- ```POST /users``` now returns an error if trying to register with an empty string for first_name, last_name or email

May 20 (Johannes)
- Autologin on register: on a succesful request to ```POST /users``` the session will now be logged in
- Add field for phone number, support in user routes
- _Schema adjustment!_
  - _Make sure to run /api/debug/reset before testing!_

May 18 (Johannes)
- Fixed problem with creating a new resource: ```current_possessor_id``` now defaults to the user creating the record

May 17 (Johannes)
- ```DELETE /api/resources/:id``` now works: deletes/undoes the request with the given ID
- ```GET /api/resources/random``` will no longer return resources without a cover image 
- ```GET /api/resources/:id``` now returns current location of the book (address)
- Fixed problem with request completion: resource record should now be properly updated with the new ```current_possessor_id``` when a request is completed.

May 14 (Johannes)
- Implemented random selection of sources: ```GET /api/resources/random?limit=n``` will return up to ```n``` random resource records
- Implemented search over all fields: ```GET /api/resources?find=term``` will return matches for ```term``` on title, authors, genres, and description.
- Run ```/api/debug/reset``` for the latest seed data updates.
  - Now 76 books from these genres: children, production, programming, theology, thrillers
  - Should have no more dead links to covers.
- Implemented cover image verification on OpenLibrary module. Backend will verify that an OL supplied cover image is retrievable or otherwise discard the URL.
- ```GET /api/resources``` now defaults to order by title if ```?order_by``` is not supplied

May 13 (Johannes)
- Implemented OpenLibrary batch retrieval tool in ```src/db/isbn-batching```. You probably won't need to use it yourself since I already updated the seed data, but here's how it works:
  - ```cd src/db/isbn-batching```
  - put text files with ISBNs into ```data``` diectory
  - run ```node index.js ./data```
  - The script will add resource records for the ISBNs in those files. The genre for each book record will default to the name of the respective text file.

May 12 (Johannes)
- _Schema adjustment!_
  - _Make sure to run /api/debug/reset before testing!_
  - requests table has an added requestee_id field that stores the id of the user to which each request is directed (that is, the person who possessed the requested resource at the time of the requeset)
- ```GET /api/requests/from_me_for_others``` will now return details on the resource and the requested user (requestee) for each request.
- ```GET /api/requests/from_others_for_me``` will now return details on the resource and the requesting user for each request.
- ```GET /api/resources/mine``` now working

May 11 (Johannes)
- ```GET /api/requests/from_me_for_others``` now working
- ```GET /api/requests/from_me_for_others/pending``` now working
- ```GET /api/requests/from_others_for_me``` now working
- ```GET /api/requests/from_others_for_me/pending``` now working
- ```POST /api/requests``` now working
- ```PUT /requests/:id/complete``` now working
- ```GET /api/resources``` now supports ```?order_by=authors```, ```?order_by=genres```

May 10 (Johannes)
- _Schema adjustment!_ 
  - _Make sure to run /api/debug/reset before testing!_
  - Redundant status fields have been removed from resources and requests tables
  - requests table has an added completed_at field (from which status can be inferred)
- ```GET /resources``` and ```GET /resources/:id``` now have status object (dynamically queried) instead of string
- ```PUT /users``` now working. Expects full user object - fields missing in the user record will be deleted from database.

May 9 (Johannes)
- ```POST /login``` now working. Expects object with email address. Sets session cookie.
- ```GET /logout``` now working. Destroys session.
- ```GET /me``` will return the current user record if session is logged in.
- ```GET /api/openlibrary/by_isbn/:isbn``` now working

May 8 (Johannes)
- Schema: resources table now using strings for authors and genres fields (no separate tables)
- ```POST /api/resources``` now working
  - returns the newly created record or an error
  - ```isbn```, ```title``` and ```authors``` are required
  - ```description``` and ```genres``` are optional
  - The fields ```cover_image```, ```current_possessor```, ```owner``` and ```status``` are optional at this time as well. We'll likely supply that data on the backend once we've figured out sessions.
- ```GET /api/users``` now functional (returns all users, not filterable, we probably do not need this in production at all - convenience functionality for now)
- ```GET /api/users/:id``` now functional
- ```POST /api/users``` now working

May 7 (Johannes)
- ```GET /api/resources``` now supporting more filtering (parameters as described below)

May 6 (Johannes)
- Created some seed data
